# Financial Dashboard in Power BI

This repository contains an interactive **Financial Dashboard** built using Power BI. The dashboard provides detailed insights into financial performance through advanced visualizations and dynamic features, providing a comprehensive tool for financial analysis and decision-making. We have made two financial dashboards with different types of visualizations for the same data itself.

## Project Overview

The **Financial Dashboard** analyzes financial performance data, focusing on trends, patterns, and actionable insights.  
Key objectives include:  
- Tracking revenue and profitability trends.  
- Understanding the geographical distribution of sales.  
- Analyzing the impact of discounts on product sales.  
- Providing tools for strategic financial decision-making.

---

## Data Sources

The dashboard is based on the **Power BI Sample Dataset**, which includes:  
- **Sales Data**: Transaction-level details such as sales amount, product categories, and regions.  
- **Discount Data**: Information on discount percentages and their application across products.  
- **Geographical Data**: Country-specific data for mapping and regional analysis.

---

## Tools Used

The following tools and technologies were utilized:  
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data modeling, visualization, and interactivity.  
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and preparation within Power BI.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated measures and advanced analytics.

---

## Data Cleaning

Before building the dashboard, extensive data cleaning was performed:  
- Handled missing values and null entries in the dataset.  
- Standardized columns to maintain uniform data formatting.  
- Resolved inconsistencies in geographical and product category data.  
- Verified relationships between tables for accurate modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key exploratory steps undertaken:  
1. **Revenue Distribution**: Analyzed sales trends across regions and time.  
2. **Discount Impact**: Identified how discounts affected product performance.  
3. **Geographical Insights**: Used mapping visuals to analyze regional data distribution.  
4. **Key Metrics Analysis**: Focused on profitability, revenue growth, and customer behavior.

---

## Results

The dashboard provides the following key insights:  
- **Top-performing Regions**: Certain regions contribute significantly to overall revenue.  
- **Product Trends**: Identified high-demand products and seasonal trends.  
- **Discount Dynamics**: Discounts have varying effects on different product categories.  
- **Profitability Analysis**: Highlighted margins and underperforming products for optimization.

---

## Recommendations

Based on the insights, the following actions are recommended:  
1. Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions to maximize revenue growth.  
2. Reassess discount strategies for low-margin products to improve profitability.  
3. Explore opportunities to expand top-selling product categories in underperforming regions.  
4. Monitor customer behavior trends to adapt inventory and supply chain strategies.

---

## Limitations

- The analysis is limited to the data provided in the sample dataset, which may not fully represent real-world scenarios.  
- Lack of demographic details limits customer segmentation analysis.  
- External factors influencing financial performance (e.g., economic conditions) are not accounted for.
